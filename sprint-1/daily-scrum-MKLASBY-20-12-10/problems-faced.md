# Problems Faced
## Meeting Date: 2020-12-10

Django is a large monolithic app structure, so it will take some time to get used to django-specific implementation details. I have not had as much time to read into React, so I will need to spend more effort on learning that library. 

We have some questions regarding the requirements for these scrum notes that will require input from the TAs.
