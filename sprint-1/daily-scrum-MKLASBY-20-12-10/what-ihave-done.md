# What I Have Done
## Meeting Date: 2020-12-10
## By: Mike Lasby

Today is the first day of the project. I spent the preceding days preparing for the project by reading documentation and tutorials for react and django. I also read the problem statement and thought about ways to approach the project. 

Today, I followed a Django REST API tutorial and created a simplified alterative django backend implementation for the pre-project exercise by extending the `viewsets.ModelViewSet` and by using the `rest_framework` `DefaultRouter` class.
