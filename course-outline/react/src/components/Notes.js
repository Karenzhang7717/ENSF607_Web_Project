You must also achieve an average of at least 50% on the lab section of the course. If you do not satisfy these caveats, you will not receive a passing grade.&#10;b) Circumstances beyond oneâ€™s control (e.g. sickness, etc.), leading to missing lab session and/or delays in assignment submissions should be discussed with the course instructor as soon as possible. Proper documentation must be provided. &#10;c) Conversion from a score out of 100 to a letter grade will be done using the    conversion chart shown below. This grading scale can only be changed during the term if the grades will not be lowered."
